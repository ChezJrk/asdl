# ASDL
There are relevant blog posts about someone's attempt to build tooling using ASDL [here](http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=ASDL#ASDL)

## TODO
- [ ] Make IRs prettyprintable (with indents, using pprint)
- [ ] write readme
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] move to standard src-layout, tooling
- Consider: Factor learning resources (notebooks) into their own repo, or subtree here?
